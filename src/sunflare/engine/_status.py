class Status:
    """
    Track the status of a potentially-lengthy action like moving or triggering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeout: float, optional
        The amount of time to wait before marking the Status as failed.  If
        ``None`` (default) wait forever. It is strongly encouraged to set a
        finite timeout.  If settle_time below is set, that time is added to the
        effective timeout.
    settle_time: float, optional
        The amount of time to wait between the caller specifying that the
        status has completed to running callbacks. Default is 0.

    Notes
    -----
    Theory of operation:

    This employs two ``threading.Event`` objects, one thread that runs for
    (timeout + settle_time) seconds, and one thread that runs for
    settle_time seconds (if settle_time is nonzero).

    At __init__ time, a *timeout* and *settle_time* are specified. A thread
    is started, on which user callbacks, registered after __init__ time via
    :meth:`add_callback`, will eventually be run. The thread waits on an
    Event be set or (timeout + settle_time) seconds to pass, whichever
    happens first.

    If (timeout + settle_time) expires and the Event has not
    been set, an internal Exception is set to ``StatusTimeoutError``, and a
    second Event is set, marking the Status as done and failed. The
    callbacks are run.

    If a callback is registered after the Status is done, it will be run
    immediately.

    If the first Event is set before (timeout + settle_time) expires,
    then the second Event is set and no internal Exception is set, marking
    the Status as done and successful. The callbacks are run.

    There are two methods that directly set the first Event. One,
    :meth:set_exception, sets it directly after setting the internal
    Exception.  The other, :meth:`set_finished`, starts a
    ``threading.Timer`` that will set it after a delay (the settle_time).
    One of these methods may be called, and at most once. If one is called
    twice or if both are called, ``InvalidState`` is raised. If they are
    called too late to prevent a ``StatusTimeoutError``, they are ignored
    but one call is still allowed. Thus, an external callback, e.g. pyepics,
    may reports success or failure after the Status object has expired, but
    to no effect because the callbacks have already been called and the
    program has moved on.
