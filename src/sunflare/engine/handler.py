class EngineHandler(ABC, Loggable):
    """`EngineHandler` abstract base class. Implements `Loggable` protocol.

    The `EngineHandler` class is a singleton that stores all the devices currently
    deployed within a RedSun hardware module. It provides access to the rest of the controller layer
    to information for each device, allowing for execution of atomic operations such as moving
    a motor or setting a light intensity.

    At startup, the `EngineHandler` is populated with the devices defined in the configuration file. These
    can be then accessed as read-only dictionaries, indexing the device by unique identifiers.

    Each engine has its own dedicated `EngineHandler` instance, with common methods that are specialized
    for the specific engine type by using inheritance.

    `EngineHandler` classes hold dictionaries that are used to group up devices by type and provide
    a key-value access to specific devices the user wants to interact with. The types of devices
    the registry can provide depend on the engine capabilities to support that type of device.
