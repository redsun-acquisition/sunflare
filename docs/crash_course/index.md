# O.O.P. crash course

This sections offers a **very quick** crash course in commonly used programming patterns in the [object-oriented programming] paradigm.

Python is a multi-paradigm language (meaning that it leverages OOP but also other paradigms), but the Redsun ecosystem mostly focuses on this paradigm.

We will use _Unified Modeling Language_ ([UML]) diagrams made with [mermaid] for visual representation of these patterns.
