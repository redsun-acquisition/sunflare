**Toolkit for Redsun development**

!!! warning
    This project is currently under active development and it may (and most likely will) receive breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

Sunflare is a Software Development Kit (SDK) which provides common, reusable components for building plugins which can interact with [Redsun](https://redsun-acquisition.github.io/redsun/).

The aim is to provide reusable patterns in developing software applications for scientific device orchestration leveraging the [Bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/main/index.html) hardware interface and data model.
