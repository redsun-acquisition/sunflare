`sunflare` is a software development kit (SDK) which provides common, reusable components for building plugins which can interact with [`redsun`](https://redsun-acquisition.github.io/redsun/).

The aim is to provide reusable patterns in developing software applications for scientific device orchestration leveraging the [Bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/main/index.html) hardware interface and data model.
