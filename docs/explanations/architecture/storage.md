# Storage

!!! note "Design inspiration"
    The storage architecture described here is heavily inspired by
    [ophyd-async](https://github.com/bluesky/ophyd-async), developed by the
    Bluesky collaboration. The patterns — shared writer, path providers,
    `FrameSink`, `StorageProxy` protocol — were adapted to fit the
    sunflare/redsun container model.

The `sunflare.storage` subpackage provides the infrastructure for writing
detector frames to a persistent store. The design follows a small set of
principles:

- **One shared writer per session** — all devices write to the same store; each device owns its own array key within it.
- **Storage is opt-in per device** — devices that need storage declare a [`StorageDescriptor`][sunflare.storage.StorageDescriptor] field; the base [`Device`][sunflare.device.Device] class carries no storage attribute.
- **The container injects the writer** — devices never construct or look up a writer themselves; the application container builds one writer and injects it into every opted-in device at session start.
- **Backend classes are internal** — only the abstract [`Writer`][sunflare.storage.Writer] and the [`StorageProxy`][sunflare.storage.StorageProxy] protocol are public; concrete backends (e.g. `ZarrWriter`) are selected and instantiated by the container from the session configuration.
- **Backend dependencies are optional extras** — `acquire-zarr` is not a core dependency of sunflare. Install `sunflare[zarr]` to enable the Zarr backend.

## Opting in to storage

A device signals that it needs storage by declaring a class-level [`StorageDescriptor`][sunflare.storage.StorageDescriptor]:

```python
import numpy as np
from sunflare.device import Device
from sunflare.storage import StorageDescriptor


class MyDetector(Device):
    storage = StorageDescriptor()

    def __init__(self, name: str, /) -> None:
        super().__init__(name)

    def prepare(self, capacity: int) -> None:
        if self.storage is None:
            raise RuntimeError("No storage backend configured for this session.")
        self.storage.update_source(
            self.name,
            dtype=np.dtype("uint16"),
            shape=(512, 512),
        )
        self._sink = self.storage.prepare(self.name, capacity=capacity)
```

The descriptor initialises to `None`; the container sets it to the shared writer
before any acquisition begins. Device code checks `self.storage is None` to handle
sessions that have no storage configured.

---

## Acquisition lifecycle

Once the writer has been injected, a device interacts with storage through a fixed
call sequence:

```python
# 1. Register the data source (dtype, shape, optional backend-specific metadata)
self.storage.update_source(self.name, dtype=np.dtype("uint16"), shape=(512, 512))

# 2. Prepare for one acquisition; returns a FrameSink bound to this device
sink = self.storage.prepare(self.name, capacity=100)

# 3. Open the backend (called once, shared across all devices)
self.storage.kickoff()

# 4. Push frames — thread-safe, multiple sinks may write concurrently
sink.write(frame)

# 5. Signal completion for this device
sink.close()
```

[`FrameSink.close`][sunflare.storage.FrameSink.close] delegates to
[`Writer.complete`][sunflare.storage.Writer.complete]. The backend is finalised
automatically once every active sink has been closed.

---

## Path providers

The writer resolves store paths through a composable
[`PathProvider`][sunflare.storage.PathProvider]. A `PathProvider` is a callable
that accepts a device name and returns a [`PathInfo`][sunflare.storage.PathInfo]
describing where and how to write that device's data.

`sunflare.storage` ships three [`FilenameProvider`][sunflare.storage.FilenameProvider]
strategies that can be composed with
[`StaticPathProvider`][sunflare.storage.StaticPathProvider]:

=== "Static filename"

    ```python
    from sunflare.storage import StaticFilenameProvider, StaticPathProvider

    # Every acquisition writes to the same filename
    path_provider = StaticPathProvider(
        StaticFilenameProvider("scan001"),
        base_uri="file:///data",
    )
    # Produces: file:///data/scan001  (array key = device name)
    ```

=== "UUID filename"

    ```python
    from sunflare.storage import UUIDFilenameProvider, StaticPathProvider

    # Each acquisition gets a unique UUID filename
    path_provider = StaticPathProvider(
        UUIDFilenameProvider(),
        base_uri="file:///data",
    )
    # Produces: file:///data/3f2504e0-...  (array key = device name)
    ```

=== "Auto-increment filename"

    ```python
    from sunflare.storage import AutoIncrementFilenameProvider, StaticPathProvider

    # Filenames increment: scan_00000, scan_00001, ...
    path_provider = StaticPathProvider(
        AutoIncrementFilenameProvider(base="scan", max_digits=5),
        base_uri="file:///data",
    )
    ```

[`PathInfo`][sunflare.storage.PathInfo] uses URIs rather than filesystem paths,
so the same provider interface works for both local (`file://`) and remote
(`s3://`) backends.

---

## The StorageProxy protocol

Device code never holds a reference to a concrete backend class. It interacts
only through the [`StorageProxy`][sunflare.storage.StorageProxy] protocol:

```python
from sunflare.storage import StorageProxy

class StorageProxy(Protocol):
    def update_source(self, name, dtype, shape, extra=None) -> None: ...
    def prepare(self, name, capacity=0) -> FrameSink: ...
    def kickoff(self) -> None: ...
    def complete(self, name) -> None: ...
    def get_indices_written(self, name=None) -> int: ...
    def collect_stream_docs(self, name, indices_written) -> Iterator[StreamAsset]: ...
```

[`Writer`][sunflare.storage.Writer] satisfies this protocol structurally. Future
remote proxy objects will too, so device code is identical regardless of whether
storage is local or remote.

!!! tip
    When testing devices in isolation, pass a `MagicMock(spec=StorageProxy)` as
    the injected writer — no real backend is needed and all interactions are
    captured for assertion.

    ```python
    from unittest.mock import MagicMock
    from sunflare.storage import StorageProxy

    device = MyDetector("camera")
    device.storage = MagicMock(spec=StorageProxy)

    device.prepare(capacity=10)
    device.storage.update_source.assert_called_once()
    ```

## Implementing a custom backend

To add a new storage backend, subclass [`Writer`][sunflare.storage.Writer] and
implement the four abstract members:

```python
from sunflare.storage import Writer, FrameSink
import numpy.typing as npt


class MyWriter(Writer):

    @property
    def mimetype(self) -> str:
        return "application/x-myformat"

    def prepare(self, name: str, capacity: int = 0) -> FrameSink:
        # backend-specific setup for this source ...
        return super().prepare(name, capacity)  # (1)

    def kickoff(self) -> None:
        if self.is_open:
            return
        # open your backend here ...
        super().kickoff()  # (2)

    def _write_frame(self, name: str, frame: npt.NDArray) -> None:
        # write one frame to the backend under the key for `name`
        ...

    def _finalize(self) -> None:
        # close the backend; called automatically when all sinks are done
        ...
```

1. `super().prepare()` resets per-source counters and returns the bound [`FrameSink`][sunflare.storage.FrameSink] — always call it.
2. `super().kickoff()` sets [`is_open`][sunflare.storage.Writer.is_open] — always call it.

!!! warning
    `_write_frame` is called by [`FrameSink.write`][sunflare.storage.FrameSink.write]
    **under the writer lock**. Do not acquire the lock again inside `_write_frame`
    or call any method that does.
