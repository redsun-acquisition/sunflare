# Statement of need

The goal of Sunflare is to provide shared and recognizable programming patterns accross the entire Redsun ecosystem.
As Redsun heavily leverages the concept of plugins, there is a need to provide a clear representation and a shared communication channel between the plugins that in the end build the desired application.

```

The diagram shows the relationship between Redsun, Sunflare and the custom plugins. Effectively, Redsun is nothing more than "glue" code that constructs your custom application. What it does is:

- retrieve the user plugins via [Python entry points];
- build said plugins and catch any possible exception throw by them;
- build the final application and connecting all the plugins together.

This approach ensures that Sunflare can be reused as a standalone package to provide reusable code to create custom control interfaces for your device, which fit the Bluesky [message protocol] and [data model].

Furthermore, if you have an existing package for hardware control, Sunflare can be used to create a wrapper for your classes which can then "talk" the Bluesky language.
