## Usage from source

### Building the documentation

If you want to build the documentation locally, you'll need to install the dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -e .[doc]
```

You can build the documentation by running the following command:

```bash
cd docs
make html

# for windows
make.bat html
```

And then open the `_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.

### Running tests

To run the tests, you'll need to install the dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Then, you can run the tests by running the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

You can also obtain a test coverage report by running the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov=sunflare --cov-report=html
```

This will generate a `htmlcov` directory with the test coverage report, which you can open in your browser by opening the `index.html` file.
